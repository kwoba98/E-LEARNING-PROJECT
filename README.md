# E-Learning Project for Working Class Students and Students Facing Unplanned Circumstances

## Introduction

This project, conducted at Kyambogo University, aims to design and implement an e-learning system specifically for working class students and those who face unplanned circumstances, preventing them from attending lectures in real-time. The system includes a recording device for lectures and an online platform to provide accessible content, ensuring these students can catch up on missed lectures.

## Problem Statement

The current mechanisms for delivering lectures and the existing online learning system (ODEL) require real-time attendance, which is not feasible for all students due to challenges such as network connectivity issues and unexpected circumstances. This results in many students missing out on important lectures and not being considered during attendance taking.

## Objectives

### Main Objective
- To design and implement an e-learning system to support working class students and students facing unplanned circumstances.

### Specific Objectives
- To design and implement a video recording device capable of filtering captured audio/voice.
- To design an online platform to upload and store recorded lecture footage.

## Justification

This project aims to ensure accessibility of lecture materials for students who cannot attend real-time sessions due to unplanned circumstances. By providing access to recorded lectures and incorporating attendance tracking, the system helps maintain academic performance and ensures students do not miss critical information.

## Significance of the Study

- **Attendance**: Guarantees attendance for students providing valid reasons for absence, which is crucial for their final evaluation.
- **Standardized Materials**: Addresses the lack of standardized lecture materials available online, providing reliable content for students' revision.

## Scope of the Study

The initial scope of the e-learning system is to assist higher education students in accessing missed lecture footage. With further revisions, the system can be adapted to support students in secondary and primary educational institutions.

## Methodology

The project was developed through extensive research, consultations, and the following procedures:

1. Recording video and audio footage of lectures.
2. Filtering audio to reduce noise.
3. Storing footage on a storage medium (e.g., flash drive, SD card).
4. Uploading footage to an established online platform to ensure only authorized access.
5. Allowing students to access content upon presenting genuine reasons for absence.

## Tools, Equipment, and Software

### Equipment
- Transducers (camera and microphone)
- Flash drive or SD card
- Capacitors and resistors for the filter circuit
- Power source (mains or battery)
- Buttons
- Computer

### Software
- Xampp server
- Text editor

### Programming Languages
- PHP
- MySQLi database
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Ajax

## Results and Discussions

The online platform successfully registered new users, provided different user privileges, uploaded and availed lecture materials, and tracked students' attendance effectively.

## Conclusions & Recommendations

The project met its primary objective of providing lecture materials to students facing unplanned circumstances. Future enhancements could include expanding the system to support various educational levels and incorporating additional features to improve user experience.

## Installation

To run the e-learning system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/e-learning-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd e-learning-project
   ```
3. Set up the server using Xampp and configure the database using the provided SQL scripts.
4. Open the project in your preferred text editor and adjust the configuration settings as needed.
5. Run the project on your local server to test its functionality.

## Usage

- Use the recording device to capture lectures.
- Upload recorded lectures to the online platform.
- Provide access to students who present valid reasons for their absence.
